      1. **Inform the User:**  
          "No Memory Bank was found. I recommend creating one to  maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Architect mode to do this?"
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If the user declines:
          <thinking>
          I need to proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
          </thinking>
          a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.
          b. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'.
          c. Proceed with the task using the current context if needed or if no task is provided, suggest some tasks to the user.
         * If the user agrees:

  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **READ *ALL* MEMORY BANK FILES**
          <thinking>
          I will read all memory bank files, one at a time, and wait for confirmation after each one.
          </thinking>
        a. **MANDATORY:** Read `productContext.md`:
            <read_file>
            <path>memory-bank/productContext.md</path>
            </read_file>

      2. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been read and is now active.
      3. Proceed with the task using the context from the Memory Bank or if no task is provided, suggest some tasks to the user.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."

    action: |
      <thinking>
      I need to update decisionLog.md with a decision, the rationale, and any implications.

  systemPatterns.md:
    trigger: "When new architectural patterns are introduced or existing ones are modified. Use your judgement."

    indicators:
      - "Context window equals or exceeds 1 Million tokens"
      - "Current Context Size displays percentage"
    threshold: 33
    actions: |
      1. **MONITOR CONTEXT WINDOW:**
         <thinking>
         I need to regularly check the context window usage percentage displayed in "Current Context Size (Tokens)" section.
         </thinking>
      2. **THRESHOLD DETECTION:**
         * When context usage reaches 33% (1/3) of maximum:
           <thinking>
           Context window is approaching critical levels that may affect performance and completion of tasks.
           </thinking>
           a. Alert user: "Context window is at [PERCENTAGE]%. To maintain optimal performance, I need to wrap up the current task and update the Memory Bank."
           b. Complete immediate subtask (don't start new complex operations)
           c. Update Memory Bank with current progress and state:
              <thinking>
              Need to ensure all relevant progress is documented in Memory Bank files for continuity.
              </thinking>
              * Use insert_content to update all relevant Memory Bank files with detailed state information
              * Ensure activeContext.md captures exact stopping point and next steps
              * Add checkpoint information to progress.md with specific continuation instructions
      3. **PREPARE FOR CLEAN RESTART:**
         * Recommend new task creation:
           <thinking>
           I need to help the user smoothly continue their work in a fresh context.
           </thinking>
           a. Provide specific instructions for continuing work
           b. Suggest using:
              <new_task>
              <mode>code</mode>
              <message>Continue from checkpoint: [SPECIFIC TASK DESCRIPTION]</message>
              </new_task>
      4. **CONTINUATION STRATEGY:**
         * First action in new session:
           <thinking>
           I need to read Memory Bank to restore full context before proceeding.
           </thinking>
           a. Read all Memory Bank files (especially checkpoint information)
           b. Acknowledge previous session stopping point
           c. Resume work from exact point of interruption

testing_workflow:
  triggers:

    - "When code reliability is critical for the feature being implemented"
  actions: |
    1. **TEST RECOMMENDATION:**
       <thinking>
       I need to evaluate if testing is appropriate for the code that was just implemented.
       </thinking>
       * When a testing trigger condition is met:
         <thinking>
         Based on the nature and scope of the changes made, testing would be beneficial.
         </thinking>
         a. Alert user: "I've completed implementing [FEATURE/CHANGE]. Would you like me to add tests for this implementation?"
         b. If the user agrees:
            <switch_mode>
            <mode_slug>test</mode_slug>
            <reason>To create appropriate tests for the implemented code.</reason>
            </switch_mode>
         c. If the user declines:
            * Document the decision in Memory Bank (if active)
            * Proceed with the next task or suggest next steps
    2. **TESTING CONSIDERATIONS:**
       * Recommendation factors to mention to the user:
         - Code complexity and risk level
         - Critical business logic implementation
         - Potential regression impacts
         - Areas where tests would provide most value
         - Appropriate testing methodology (unit, integration, e2e)
